Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using Python.
Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Implemented Logistic Regression for classification and achieved an accuracy of 92%.
Trained the model on a dataset from Kaggle (20,000+ articles).
Built using pandas, nltk, scikit-learn for data handling, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
